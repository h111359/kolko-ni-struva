## What

After the data is downloaded, the files in downloads folder should be parsed and from them should be created/refreshed a file in data folder with name shops-nomenclature.json. It should have artificially generated ID for the shop and shop name from the files in downloads for the days downloaded. The origin of the data should be the field 'Търговски обект' in the downloaded from internet files. When data.csv is created, it should contain the shop ID instead of the full name. this change should be reflected in the script.js, index.html files as well in order to read properly the changed structure.

## What the user imagines:

- When update-kolko-ni-struva.py is executed, on each file red from download to be updated the nomenclature shops-nomenclature.json in data/ folder; 

- The structure of data.csv to be changed and the name of the shop to be replaced by the ID from the nomenclature shops-nomenclature.json; 

- html and java script files to be changed so to correctly read from the new data schema; 4. No changes to other algorithms, settings and styles.
