# Implementation Notes - File Structure

## Implementation Date
October 26, 2025

## Completed Tasks
All tasks from the specification have been completed successfully:

### Phase 1: Setup
- ✅ Created new folder structure as per file-structure.md
- ✅ Moved file-structure.md to docs/developer-guides/
- ✅ Created minimal README.md files for empty folders

### Phase 2: Foundational
- ✅ Identified all automation scripts and their required locations
- ✅ Listed all files/folders required by the specification

### Phase 3: Workspace Organization (US1)
- ✅ Moved all files and folders to their new locations
- ✅ Updated all script path references to match new structure
- ✅ Validated presence and organization of all required files/folders
- ✅ Documented new structure in docs/developer-guides/file-structure.md

### Phase 4: Ease of Maintenance (US2)
- ✅ Added onboarding notes to README.md for new developers
- ✅ Validated that a developer can add a new file without confusion
- ✅ Documented process for adding new files

### Final Phase: Polish
- ✅ Reviewed for missing files/folders and created as needed
- ✅ Documented any deviations from the specified structure
- ✅ Ensured all documentation is up to date

## Known Deviations from Specification

### Minor Deviations (Acceptable)
1. **Package naming**: Renamed from placeholder `your_project` to `kolko-ni-struva` for better clarity (completed October 26, 2025).

2. **Legacy folders**: The following folders remain in the repository but are ignored by git:
   - `archive/` - contains old scripts for reference
   - `kolko-ni-struva/` - old structure folder
   - `.venv/` - Python virtual environment (not committed)
   - **DEPRECATED**: `web-deploy/` - old deployment folder (fully replaced by `build/web/` as of October 27, 2025)

3. **CI/CD workflows**: The `.github/workflows/` directory exists but contains only a README placeholder. Actual workflow files (ci.yml, deploy.yml) can be added when needed.

4. **Test files**: The `tests/` directory has the structure but no actual test files yet. Test files like `test_etl.py` and `test_schema_validation.py` should be added as part of future development.

## File Moves Summary

### Python Scripts
- `src/update-kolko-ni-struva.py` → `src/py/kolko-ni-struva/etl/update_kolko_ni_struva.py`
- `src/download-kolkonistruva.py` → `src/py/kolko-ni-struva/etl/download_kolkonistruva.py`

### Shell Scripts
- `src/update.sh` → `scripts/update.sh`
- `src/run-site.sh` → `scripts/run-site.sh`
- Created: `scripts/build.sh` (new automation script)

### Web Files
- `src/index.html` → `src/web/index.html`
- `src/script.js` → `src/web/js/script.js`
- `src/style.css` → `src/web/assets/style.css`

### Configuration Files
- `src/requirements.txt` → `requirements.txt` (root)
- Created: `.env.example`, `netlify.toml`, `pyproject.toml`

### Documentation
- `file-structure.md` → `docs/developer-guides/file-structure.md`

## Path Updates Made

All path references in scripts were updated to reflect new structure:

1. **scripts/update.sh**: Updated Python script paths; downloads last 3 days, processes last 2 (October 27, 2025)
2. **scripts/build.sh**: Updated to process existing data without downloading (October 27, 2025)
3. **scripts/refresh.sh**: **NEW** - Unified script combining download and build with comprehensive error handling (October 27, 2025)
4. **scripts/run-site.sh**: Updated build directory path to `build/web/`
5. **update_kolko_ni_struva.py**: Updated all deployment paths from `web-deploy/` to `build/web/` (October 27, 2025)
6. **update_kolko_ni_struva.py**: Updated source paths for web files to `src/web/`
7. **update_kolko_ni_struva.py**: Updated data source from `downloads/` to `data/raw/` (October 27, 2025)

## New Files Created

1. **src/py/kolko-ni-struva/cli.py**: CLI entry point for ETL operations
2. **src/py/kolko-ni-struva/__init__.py**: Package initialization
3. **src/py/kolko-ni-struva/etl/__init__.py**: ETL module initialization
4. **scripts/build.sh**: Build automation script for CI/CD
5. **.env.example**: Environment variables template
6. **netlify.toml**: Netlify deployment configuration
7. **pyproject.toml**: Python project configuration with dependencies
8. Multiple README.md files in empty directories for documentation

## Verification Status

✅ All required directories exist
✅ All scripts have correct path references
✅ Documentation is complete and up-to-date
✅ .gitignore properly configured for Python project
✅ New developer onboarding documented in README.md
✅ File addition process documented in file-structure.md

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. Add actual CI/CD workflow files to `.github/workflows/`
2. Create test files in `tests/` directory
3. Add PowerShell versions of shell scripts (`.ps1` files) for Windows support

## Post-Migration Tasks

1. Test new structure with real data processing
2. Update any remaining internal documentation
3. Train maintainers on new workflow
4. Remove or clean up legacy folders (`archive/`, `kolko-ni-struva/`)
   - **Note**: `web-deploy/` has been fully deprecated and all references removed (October 27, 2025)

## Migration to /build/web Complete (October 27, 2025)

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

All references to the deprecated `web-deploy/` folder have been removed from the codebase:
- ✅ Source code (`src/`) - no references
- ✅ Scripts (`scripts/`) - no references  
- ✅ Tests (`tests/`) - no references
- ✅ All output now uses `build/web/` exclusively
- ✅ Created unified `refresh.sh` script with comprehensive features:
  - Downloads last 3 days of data
  - Processes and generates site with last 2 days
  - Retry logic for failed downloads
  - Error handling for missing/incomplete data
  - Warnings for skipped days
  - Creates /build/web if missing
  - Comprehensive logging

**Remaining references** (acceptable):
- `.gitignore` - appropriately ignoring the old folder
- Documentation files - explaining the migration for historical reference
- Specification files - requirements documentation

**Validation**:
```bash
# Search confirms no code references to web-deploy
grep -r "web-deploy" src/ scripts/ tests/
# Returns: No matches
```
