# 2. Requirements

After the data is downloaded, the files in downloads folder should be parsed and from them should be created/refreshed a file in data folder with name shops-nomenclature.json. It should have artificially generated ID for the shop and shop name from the files in downloads for the days downloaded. The origin of the data should be the field 'Търговски обект' in the downloaded from internet files. When data.csv is created, it should contain the shop ID instead of the full name. this change should be reflected in the script.js, index.html files as well in order to read properly the changed structure.
