# Specification Quality Checklist: Implement New File Structure

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 26, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)



## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed
- [x] All scripts are referenced and their placement is documented




## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable (including for scripts)
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified (including script path errors)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
- [x] Only script paths are changed, not logic
- [x] Missing files/folders are created with probable content
- [x] Secure file move methods are used to minimize changes



## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria (including script updates)
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria (including script execution)
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
