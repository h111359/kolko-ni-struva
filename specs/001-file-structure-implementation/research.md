## Phase 0: Outline & Research

### Unknowns & Clarifications
- Additional dependencies required for script compatibility: No
- Performance goals for file operations (e.g., move, copy): N/A

### Research Tasks
- Research additional dependencies required for automation scripts to work after file structure change
- Research best practices for moving files and folders in Python/bash to preserve history and minimize risk
- Research performance goals for file operations in similar Python projects

### Best Practices
- For Python-first projects, use `git mv` for tracked files to preserve history
- For automation scripts, update only path references unless script fails to run
- For new folders, add minimal README.md to clarify purpose

### Decision Log
- Decision: Use Python 3.9+, requests, beautifulsoup4, lxml as base dependencies
- Rationale: Aligns with constitution and current project stack
- Alternatives considered: None needed unless new requirements arise

- Decision: Use manual and basic script execution tests for validation
- Rationale: Spec requires basic coverage, constitution encourages automation
- Alternatives considered: Full test automation (not required for this feature)

- Decision: Use single project structure as default
- Rationale: No complexity justified for multi-project layout
- Alternatives considered: Web/mobile split (not needed)

## Consolidated Findings
All unknowns and clarifications are resolved for planning. Any new unknowns during implementation will be documented and researched as needed.
