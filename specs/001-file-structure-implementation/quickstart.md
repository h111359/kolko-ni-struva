## Quickstart Guide: New File Structure Implementation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd kolko-ni-struva
```

### 2. Verify file structure
- Ensure all files and folders match the layout in `docs/developer-guides/file-structure.md`.

### 3. Run automation scripts
- All scripts should be in their documented locations.
- Execute scripts to verify correct path usage and functionality.

### 4. Add new files
- Place new files in the appropriate folder as described in the file structure documentation.
- For empty folders, add a minimal `README.md` explaining the folder's purpose.

### 5. Troubleshooting
- If a script fails, check for outdated path references and update as needed.
- Report any deviations from the documented structure.

### 6. Onboarding
- New team members should review `docs/developer-guides/file-structure.md` for guidance on file locations and project organization.
