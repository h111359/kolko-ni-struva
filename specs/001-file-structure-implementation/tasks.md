# Tasks: Implement New File Structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Project Initialization)
- [ ] T001 Create new folder structure as per file-structure.md
- [ ] T002 Move file-structure.md to docs/developer-guides/file-structure.md
- [ ] T003 Create minimal README.md files for empty folders

## Phase 2: Foundational Tasks (Blocking Prerequisites)
- [ ] T004 Identify all automation scripts and their required locations
- [ ] T005 List all files/folders required by the specification

## Phase 3: User Story 1 (Workspace Organization)
- [ ] T006 [P] [US1] Move all files and folders to their new locations as per file-structure.md
- [ ] T007 [P] [US1] Update all script path references to match new structure
- [ ] T008 [US1] Validate presence and organization of all required files/folders
- [ ] T009 [US1] Document new structure in docs/developer-guides/file-structure.md

## Phase 4: User Story 2 (Ease of Maintenance)
- [ ] T010 [P] [US2] Add onboarding notes to README.md for new developers
- [ ] T011 [US2] Validate that a developer can add a new file without confusion
- [ ] T012 [US2] Document process for adding new files in docs/developer-guides/file-structure.md

## Final Phase: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns
- [ ] T016 Review for missing files/folders and create as needed
- [ ] T017 Document any deviations from the specified structure
- [ ] T018 Ensure all documentation is up to date

---

## Dependencies
- US1 must be completed before US2
- Foundational tasks must be completed before user story phases

## Parallel Execution Examples
- T006 and T007 ([US1]) can be executed in parallel (different files)

## Independent Test Criteria
- US1: Verify all files/folders are present and organized
- US2: Developer can add a file without confusion

## MVP Scope
- Complete all tasks for US1 (T006â€“T009)

## Format Validation
- All tasks follow strict checklist format: checkbox, ID, [P] if parallelizable, [USx] for user story phases, description with file path
