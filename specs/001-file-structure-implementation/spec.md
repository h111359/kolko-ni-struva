# Feature Specification: Implement New File Structure
## Clarifications
### Session 2025-10-26
 - Q: How should "strictly necessary for compatibility" be interpreted for script logic changes? → A: Only update paths, no logic changes unless script fails to run
 - Q: What are the scale/scope assumptions for repository size? → A: Repository size: <1000 files, <500MB
 - Q: What level of test automation coverage is required for the file structure change? → A: Basic script execution tests

# Feature Specification: Implement New File Structure

**Feature Branch**: `001-file-structure-implementation`
**Created**: October 26, 2025
**Status**: Draft

**Input**: User description: "A new file structure need to be implemented"

**Reference**: See [file-structure.md](../../file-structure.md) for the detailed folder and file layout. All automation scripts must be placed in their proper locations and updated to work with the new structure.
**Compatibility Note**: The current solution, as implemented in the existing file and folder structure, is a fully workable solution. The new file organization must preserve all existing capabilities and ensure the solution remains functional after restructuring. No loss of functionality or breakage is permitted.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Workspace Organization (Priority: P1)

A developer opens the project and finds all files and folders organized according to the new structure, making navigation and development easier.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value of the feature; without it, the new structure is not delivered.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying the presence and organization of all required files and folders in the workspace.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the workspace is opened, **When** the developer inspects the file tree, **Then** all files and folders are present and correctly organized as per the new structure.
2. **Given** a new team member joins, **When** they start working, **Then** they can easily locate files due to the clear structure.

### User Story 2 - Ease of Maintenance (Priority: P2)

A developer can quickly identify where to add new files or make changes, reducing onboarding and maintenance time.

**Why this priority**: Improves long-term maintainability and team productivity.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by asking a developer to add a new file and observing if they can do so without confusion.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer needs to add a new feature, **When** they look for the appropriate location, **Then** they find it quickly due to the logical structure.

---

### User Story 3 - Consistency Across Environments (Priority: P3)

The file structure remains consistent when cloned or deployed in different environments.

**Why this priority**: Ensures reliability and reduces environment-specific issues.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by cloning the repository on a new machine and verifying the structure matches the specification.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the repository is cloned, **When** the file tree is inspected, **Then** the structure matches the defined organization.

### Edge Cases

- What happens if a required folder is missing?
- How does the system handle extra files or folders not specified in the structure?
- What if a script references an outdated path or location?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*


### Functional Requirements


**FR-001**: System MUST provide a workspace with the new file/folder organization as described in [file-structure.md](../../file-structure.md).
**FR-001a**: The file `file-structure.md` MUST be moved to its proper place as described inside itself: `docs/developer-guides/file-structure.md`. Do not invent another file or location; move the exact file.
**FR-002**: All required files and folders MUST be present after implementation.
**FR-003**: The structure MUST be documented for future reference and onboarding.
**FR-004**: The structure MUST remain consistent across different environments (local, CI/CD, deployment).
**FR-005**: System MUST alert or document any deviations from the specified structure.
**FR-006**: All automation scripts (shell, PowerShell) MUST be placed in their proper locations as defined in [file-structure.md](../../file-structure.md).
**FR-007**: All scripts MUST be updated to work with the new folder and file structure, including correct path references and outputs.
**FR-008**: Only script paths should be changed; script logic and functionality must remain untouched unless strictly necessary for compatibility.
For this feature, logic changes are permitted only if a script fails to run after the structure change; otherwise, update only the paths.
**FR-009**: Any missing files or folders required by the specification should be created with the most probable and minimal viable content (e.g., README.md for empty folders, template scripts for automation).
**FR-010**: When moving or updating files, use secure methods (e.g., `git mv`, `mv` with backup, or equivalent) to guarantee minimal changes and preserve file history, rather than recreating files from scratch.


### Key Entities

- **File**: Represents a unit of code, documentation, configuration, or automation (including scripts). Key attributes: name, location, purpose.
- **Folder**: Represents a logical grouping of files. Key attributes: name, contents, hierarchy.
- **Script**: Automation file (shell or PowerShell) that performs build, test, deploy, or other project tasks. Key attributes: location, compatibility, correct path usage.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*


### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of required files, folders, and scripts are present and correctly organized after implementation.
- **SC-002**: Developers can locate files and scripts within 30 seconds on first attempt.
- **SC-003**: All automation scripts execute successfully in the new structure without path errors.
- **SC-004**: New team members report no confusion about file or script locations during onboarding.
- **SC-005**: No environment-specific issues related to file structure or script execution are reported after deployment.
