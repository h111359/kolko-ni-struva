# Functional & Data Integrity Requirements Quality Checklist: Set to Work on Current File Structure

**Purpose**: Validate functional requirements and data integrity before implementation
**Created**: October 27, 2025
**Feature**: [/specs/002-set-to-work-on-current-file-structure/spec.md]

## Requirement Completeness
- [ ] CHK001 - Are all steps of the unified data refresh workflow explicitly documented? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 1]
- [ ] CHK002 - Is the process for downloading the last 3 days and preparing the last 2 days of data clearly specified? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 1,2]
- [ ] CHK003 - Are acceptance scenarios for data preparation accuracy fully defined? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 2]
- [ ] CHK004 - Is the elimination of deprecated references (e.g., /web-deploy) documented as a requirement? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 3]

## Requirement Clarity
- [ ] CHK005 - Are terms like "last 3 days" and "last 2 days" unambiguously defined (e.g., by date format, time zone)? [Clarity, Spec §User Story 1,2]
- [ ] CHK006 - Is the target output folder (/build/web) clearly specified for all generated site artifacts? [Clarity, Spec §User Story 1]

## Requirement Consistency
- [ ] CHK007 - Do requirements for data download and site generation align across all user stories? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 1,2]
- [ ] CHK008 - Are there any conflicting instructions regarding folder structure or data selection? [Consistency, Gap]

## Data Integrity Coverage
- [ ] CHK009 - Are requirements for validating the integrity of downloaded and processed data specified? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1,2]
- [ ] CHK010 - Is error handling for incomplete or corrupt data downloads addressed in the requirements? [Coverage, Gap]
- [ ] CHK011 - Are edge cases (e.g., missing data for a day, duplicate files) covered in the requirements? [Edge Case, Gap]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality
- [ ] CHK012 - Are success criteria for each functional requirement measurable and technology-agnostic? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §User Story 1,2,3]
- [ ] CHK013 - Can the requirements be objectively verified without reference to implementation details? [Measurability, Spec §User Story 1,2,3]

## Traceability & Assumptions
- [ ] CHK014 - Are all dependencies and assumptions (e.g., data source availability, script permissions) documented? [Assumption, Gap]
- [ ] CHK015 - Is a requirement & acceptance criteria ID scheme established for traceability? [Traceability, Gap]
