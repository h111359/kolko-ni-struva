# Phase 0 Research Tasks and Findings

## Research Tasks

1. Research scale/scope for expected maintainers and public web users
2. Clarify any additional dependencies required beyond requests, beautifulsoup4, lxml

## Findings

### 1. Scale/Scope for Expected Users
- **Decision**: Target audience is maintainers (internal) and public web users (external)
- **Rationale**: Maintainers need reliable refresh and build workflows; public users require fast, accessible web reports
- **Alternatives considered**: Limiting to internal use only (rejected: public reporting is a core feature)

### 2. Additional Dependencies
- **Decision**: No additional dependencies required for MVP; requests, beautifulsoup4, lxml are sufficient
- **Rationale**: Constitution mandates minimal dependencies; these cover all ETL and web scraping needs
- **Alternatives considered**: pandas, numpy, flask (rejected: not needed for current scope)

All clarifications resolved. Ready to proceed to Phase 1: Design & Contracts.
