# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*


  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently

## Feature Specification: Data File Refactor

**Feature Branch**: `003-data-file-refactor`
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Redesign build/web/data.csv to remove repeating data, move it to dimension files, keep data.csv small for faster web page load. New dimension files should be generated and ETL scripts should update them automatically. Acceptance: no repeating data in data.csv, additional nomenclature files generated and referred, new nomenclatures automatically maintained."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Fast Data Load (Priority: P1)

As a web user, I want the site to load data quickly so I can access information without delay.

**Why this priority**: Directly impacts user experience and engagement.

**Independent Test**: Measure page load time before and after refactor; verify data loads within target time.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the refactored data files, **When** the web page loads, **Then** the data appears within 2 seconds.
2. **Given** a large dataset, **When** loading the page, **Then** no noticeable delay occurs.

---

### User Story 2 - Accurate Data Reference (Priority: P2)

As a developer or data maintainer, I want data.csv to reference dimension files so that data is not duplicated and is easy to maintain.

**Why this priority**: Reduces errors and simplifies updates.

**Independent Test**: Inspect data.csv and dimension files; verify no repeating data and correct references.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new entry in a dimension file, **When** data.csv is updated, **Then** the reference is correct and no duplicate data exists.

---

### User Story 3 - Automated Dimension Maintenance (Priority: P3)

As a data engineer, I want ETL scripts to automatically update dimension files so that dimension data remains current without manual intervention.

**Why this priority**: Ensures data integrity and reduces manual workload.

**Independent Test**: Run ETL scripts; verify dimension files are updated automatically when new data is added.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** new raw data, **When** ETL scripts run, **Then** dimension files are updated and referenced correctly in data.csv.

---

### Edge Cases

- If a dimension value is missing or not found, the system will insert a placeholder value (e.g., "UNKNOWN") for the missing entry.
- If a raw CSV file contains malformed or incomplete data rows, the ETL process will skip those rows, log them to a JSON-formatted error log file with details (timestamp, row number, error type, raw data), and continue processing the valid rows.
- If a dimension file exceeds 10 MB or 100,000 rows, the system will log a warning and may require manual review or archival strategy.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST refactor data.csv to remove all repeating data.
- **FR-002**: System MUST generate separate dimension files for repeating data (nomenclatures).
- **FR-003**: System MUST update data.csv to reference dimension files using integer IDs instead of duplicating data.
- **FR-004**: ETL scripts MUST automatically create new dimension entries when encountering new values during data processing (no manual intervention required for dimension maintenance).
- **FR-004a**: ETL scripts SHOULD log all newly created dimension entries to an audit log file for review purposes (enhancement feature).
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure web page loads data within acceptable time limits (see Success Criteria).
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle missing or malformed data gracefully by skipping malformed rows, logging errors, and continuing to process valid data. A row is considered malformed if it fails any validation rule defined in data-model.md Section "Validation Rules", including: missing required fields (date, IDs, category), invalid data types (non-numeric prices, invalid date format), constraint violations (negative prices, promo_price > retail_price), or missing dimension references that cannot be resolved.
- **FR-007**: ETL scripts MUST log all skipped malformed rows to a JSON-formatted error log file for review and potential manual correction.
- **FR-008**: System MUST monitor dimension file sizes and log a warning if any file exceeds 10 MB or 100,000 rows.
- **FR-009**: When audit logging is enabled (FR-004a), dimension creation logs MUST use JSON format with structured fields including timestamps, dimension type, ID, and attributes. 

### Key Entities

- **data.csv**: Main data file that references dimension files using integer IDs, contains no repeating data.
- **Dimension Files**: Separate JSON files for categories, cities, trade chains, etc.; each entry has an integer ID and associated attributes. Referenced by data.csv via integer IDs.
- **ETL Scripts**: Automated processes that update dimension files and data.csv, maintaining ID mappings.
- **Log Files**: JSON-formatted files that track ETL errors (skipped rows) and audit events (new dimension entries) with structured fields including timestamps, error types, and affected data.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Web page loads data in under 2 seconds for standard dataset size.
- **SC-002**: No repeating data exists in data.csv after refactor.
- **SC-003**: All dimension files are automatically updated by ETL scripts when new data is added.
- **SC-004**: 100% of references in data.csv correctly point to dimension files.
- **SC-005**: No manual intervention required for dimension maintenance after initial setup.


## Clarifications
### Session 2025-10-27
- Q: How should the system handle missing dimension values when processing data (e.g., if a required value for a category, city, or trade chain is not found during ETL)? → A: Insert a placeholder value (e.g., "UNKNOWN").
- Q: How should the system handle malformed or incomplete data in raw CSV files during ETL processing? → A: Skip the malformed row, log it, and continue processing valid rows.
- Q: What is the maximum acceptable size threshold for a dimension file before action needs to be taken? → A: 10 MB or 100,000 rows.
- Q: What reference method should data.csv use to link to dimension files (e.g., integer IDs, string codes, or composite keys)? → A: Integer IDs (e.g., 1, 2, 3...).
- Q: Should ETL scripts create new dimension entries automatically when encountering new values, or require manual approval? → A: Automatically create new entries and log them to audit file.
- Q: What format should be used for the error/audit log files that track skipped rows and new dimension entries? → A: JSON format with structured fields.

## Assumptions

- Standard dataset size is defined as current production volume.
- ETL scripts are run regularly as part of data pipeline.
- Data integrity checks are performed during ETL.
